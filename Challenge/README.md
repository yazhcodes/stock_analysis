# STOCK ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

This project is about analyzing Green energy stock data of a dozen tickers to identify the ones that would be best to invest in, based on their Total Daily Volume and Returns in the past couple of years.

## RESULTS

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script

### Stock Performance in 2017 vs 2018

Upon comparing and visualizing the stock returns of various tickers over 2017 and 2018, it is quite evident that Green energy has suffered a significant loss in 2018, with the exception of ***Sunrun Inc***, a Solar Company that has seen an increase in return of over 78% in two years. It is undoubtedly the best green stock to invest at this point of time.
